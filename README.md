# Performance plots archive 2026

![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/segmentlinking/performance-plots-archive-2026)

This repository is used as an archive for plots made by the CI workflow for each pull request of the [SegmentLinking/cmssw](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/cmssw) repository. It aims to permanently store validation and comparison plots, so that it is easier to keep track of progress and look back in cases when it is found that a PR introduced an issue.

Plots from CI runs prior to 2026 can be found [here](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/TrackLooper-plots-archive/tree/main). The plots produced by the CI in [SegmentLinking/TrackLooper](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/TrackLooper) can be found in [here](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/TrackLooper-plots-archive/tree/main).

The contents of this repository should not be modified manually, as the entire process is designed to be fully automated.
